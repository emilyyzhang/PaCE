## Overview
This repository contains the necessary code and data to run experiments and visualize results using the Jupyter notebook `Experiment.ipynb`. 

## Structure

### Folders
- `raw_data`: This folder contains the raw data files used in the experiments.
- `results`: This directory contains the results from previous experiments.

### Files
- `Experiment.ipynb`: This is the primary Jupyter notebook where you can run code blocks to execute experiments and visualize results.
- `estimator.py`: Contains the implementation of the Panel Clustering Estimator (PaCE).
- `experiment_utils.py`: Includes functions that are used for the experiments.

## Running the Experiments
To run the experiments:
1. Open the `Experiment.ipynb` notebook.
2. Execute the code blocks to run the experiments and visualize the results.
